Google Voice SIP service status
===============================

This is a simple application running on Google App Engine which displays the
GV SIP service availability.

It's live running at http://gvoice-sip-status.appspot.com


How does it work?
-----------------

Every 5 minutes a cron job (running on GAE) makes a request to a SIPwPing
(https://github.com/saghul/SIPwPing-server) server which will make a SIP
OPTIONS request to the specified SIP URI and return the result in JSON
format. This value is saved in Google App Engine's DataStore.

Every time the page is viewed this data will be fetched and rendered.


Man, your code sucks!
--------------------

This is my first application on GAE, I just wanted to try it out, so don't
punish me very hard! Of course, pull requests are welcome :-)
